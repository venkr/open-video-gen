# Open Video Generation Platform - Development Plan

## Project Overview
A client-side-heavy, modular video generation platform that allows users to create videos through a customizable AI pipeline. The platform uses a bring-your-own-keys model and features a grid-based interface where users can connect different AI models to create complete video generation workflows.

## Core Architecture

### Client-Side Architecture
- **Client-side heavy**: Most logic and state management happens in the browser
- **Bring-your-own-keys**: Users provide their own API keys for various AI services
- **localStorage heavy**: Store pipeline configurations, user preferences, and state locally
- **Server role**: Handle actual AI model generations and heavy compute tasks

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js with React
- **Components**: shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with thick shadows/borders + poppy colors (blocks.css/comparevoiceai.com style)
- **State Management**: localStorage + React state
- **Backend**: Minimal server for AI model orchestration

## Key Features

### 1. Grid-Based Pipeline Builder
- **Visual Interface**: Drag-and-drop blocks representing AI models
- **Adjacent Blocks**: Connected pipeline steps that pass data between models
- **Real-time Preview**: See pipeline structure as you build
- **Save/Load**: Store pipeline configurations in localStorage

### 2. AI Model Integration
**Script Generation**
- LLAMP and other text generation models
- Prompt engineering interface
- Script refinement tools

**Image Generation**
- Multiple image generation models (DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion)
- Style transfer and image editing capabilities
- Batch generation support

**Voice/Audio Generation**
- Text-to-speech models
- Voice cloning capabilities
- Audio editing and mixing

**Video Generation**
- Video driving/compilation models
- Lip-sync generation
- Video editing and effects

### 3. Modular Model System
- **Abstract Interfaces**: Standardized input/output formats between models
- **Hot-swappable Models**: Easy model replacement within pipeline
- **Custom Model Support**: Plugin system for new AI models
- **Multi-modal Support**: Handle text, image, audio, and video data types

## User Interface Design

### Design System
- **Background**: Clean white background
- **Colors**: Poppy, vibrant colors for accents and highlights
- **Shadows**: Thick, pronounced shadows (inspired by blocks.css)
- **Borders**: Bold, defined borders for visual hierarchy
- **Typography**: Clear, readable fonts with strong contrast

### Key UI Components
1. **Pipeline Canvas**: Main grid-based workspace
2. **Model Library**: Sidebar with available AI models
3. **Properties Panel**: Configure selected model parameters
4. **Output Preview**: Real-time generation results
5. **API Key Management**: Secure key storage interface

## Data Flow & State Management

### Local State (localStorage)
- Pipeline configurations
- User preferences and settings
- API key storage (encrypted)
- Generation history and cache
- Custom model configurations

### Server Communication
- Model generation requests
- File upload/download handling
- Heavy compute operations
- Result caching and optimization

   - Image generation models (DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
   - Basic TTS models

### Phase 3: Pipeline Execution
1. **Execution Engine**
   - Pipeline validation and optimization
   - Asynchronous model execution
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Progress tracking and user feedback

2. **Server Integration**
   - API endpoints for model execution
   - File handling and storage
   - Caching system for expensive operations

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. **Advanced UI**
   - Real-time preview system
   - Batch processing capabilities
